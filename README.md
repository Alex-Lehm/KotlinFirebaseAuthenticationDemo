## Kotlin Firebase Authentication Demonstration

A simple (no validation!) demonstration of a login/registration system in a Kotlin application using
Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database.

Based on Firebase Email/Password authentication, and includes one custom field.

To run on your own Firebase system, you will need to replace `google-services.json` and add your Realtime Database URL in `LoginActivity.kt` and `RegisterActivity.kt`.
